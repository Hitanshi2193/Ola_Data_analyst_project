# Ride Booking Analytics Dashboard (OLAP-Based)

###  Business Use Case

This project replicates the backend and analytical operations of an Ola/Uber-like platform. The focus is on building an OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) dashboard to explore large-scale ride booking data  covering cancellations, ride patterns, turnaround time, and customer-driver ratings. The dashboard supports business decision-making through rich visuals and drill-down analytics.

### Why I Built This

As a Business Analyst working with BI tools, I wanted to simulate a real-world transportation app scenario. This dataset of ~1 lakh rows mimics the day-to-day operations of a ride-hailing platform. From understanding booking failures to identifying top-rated drivers this project gave me the opportunity to apply SQL, Power BI, Power Query, and DAX in a dynamic business case.

### Tools & Technologies Used

- *Power BI*: Visual dashboard creation  
- *Power Query*: Data transformation and preprocessing  
- *SQL (PostgreSQL compatible)*: Data aggregation and querying  
- *DAX*: Custom measures and KPIs  
- *OLAP Concepts*: Fact-dimension schema exploration, slice and dice filtering

### Key Features of the Dashboard

- Analyze total, successful, cancelled, and incomplete bookings  
- Visualize average turnaround time (TAT) by vehicle type  
- Identify ride trends by pickup & drop locations  
- Compare driver and customer satisfaction via ratings  
- Drill into cancellation reasons and payment method breakdown  
- Filter insights by vehicle type, payment mode, booking status, and more
